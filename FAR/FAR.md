	* Neighborhood rezonings
	* Lot size, lot coverage, yard requirements, height limits
* **Current status of policy:**
	* **Update?** Doesn't need update
	* **Description:** FAR is such a fundamental of zoning, and this tool is abstracted enough, that this project is unlikely to need updating.

	* Christine Gaspar
	* Mark Torrey
* **CUP Partners who worked on the project:**
