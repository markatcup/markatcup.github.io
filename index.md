## Welcome to CUP's Policy Tracker

### Introduction
This is a project to track the current status of all policies behind CUP
projects.  Because CUP's projects are (more often than not) either showing how
a particular public policy works, or helping people understand their rights
based on a set of public policies, there is a risk that the policies will be
changed, and if that happens the CUP project will no longer be accurate. This
is particularly important to CUP because so many projects are printed on paper,
and updating or changing them is not as simple as pushing an edit to a website.

Goals of this project include:
* Listing specific public policies a given CUP project is based on.
* Listing resources for where information about those policies might be found.
* Explaining the current status of the policy, and whether it is settled law, or likely to change in the future.
* If the policy has changed since the CUP project was published, letting CUP staff know that they might want to reach out to partners about updating the project.

For more detailed information on the specific fields that need to be covered
for a given project, [see this list](./project_tracking-fields.md).
