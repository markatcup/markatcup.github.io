## What is Mandatory Inclusionary Housing?
* http://welcometocup.org/Projects/EnvisioningDevelopment/WhatIsMandatoryInclusionaryHousing
* **Published:** 2018
* **Public Policy:** Mandatory Inclusionary Housing
	* Mandatory Inclusionary Housing is a set of zoning rules that requires developers of new buildings to include some portion of the buildings as affordable housing.
	* MIH went through ULURP and was added to the NYC Zoning Resolution in 2016.
	* Generally, it only applies to places in the city that have been rezoned since 2016. That includes area-wide neighborhood rezoning, and also rezonings for specific developments above a certain size.
