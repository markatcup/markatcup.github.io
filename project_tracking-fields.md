## Specs for policy tracking

### General specs:
* Each CUP project should get it's own page.
* Each page/project should have the list of fields listed below filled in for it.
* Projects like ULURP and Zoning which cover a wide range of policies might need to be broken out into sub-pages for each major policy section.

### Fields you need to capture about each CUP project:
* Name of project
	* Link to project on CUP site
* Year printed (ie when it was last up-to-date)
* Latest date policy status was checked
* Policy it covers
	* This might require a short description as well as a long-form details field
	* Details about particular angles/perspective on the policy the project takes
	* Oddball small things that need to be kept in mind/looked out for/addressed
* Current status of policy:
	* Short field: needs update or not
	* Long field:
		* What's going on in the world around this policy
		* Future outlook for policy
		* Challenges for updating project, in terms of policy
		* Sources
* Partner(s) who worked on it with us
	* Should we contact them about an update to project?
	* Their website/other ways to reach them
* CUP staff(s) who worked on it, so you can ask them questions
* Random notes:
	* Great ideas for visuals that could better show how the policy works.
	* Edits that should be made, but are maybe too minor to merit a reprint.
	* People who love the project and might want to know if you update it.

### Optional fields:
* Designer?
	* This doesn't matter in terms of policy, but it could be useful for other purposes
* Format?
