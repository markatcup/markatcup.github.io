## Fields you need to capture about each CUP project:
* Name of project
* Year printed (ie when it was last up-to-date)
* Latest date policy status was checked
* Policy it covers
	* This might require a short description as well as a long-form details field
	* Details about particular angles/perspective on the policy the project takes
	* Oddball small things that need to be kept in mind/looked out for/addressed
* Current status of policy:
	* Short field: needs update or not
	* Long field:
		* What's going on in the world around this policy
		* Future outlook for policy
		* Challenges for updating project, in terms of policy
		* Sources
* Partner(s) who worked on it with us
	* Should we contact them about an update to project?
* CUP staff(s) who worked on it
* Random notes:
	* Great ideas for a visual that could better show how the policy works
* (Designer?)
	* I don't care about this in terms of policy, buf it you build this thing out, it could be useful for other purposes
* (Format?)
